## Frontend Updates - SkillContext

### Changes Made to SkillContext
1. **New Types and Interfaces**
   - Added `NewSkillData` interface to match the backend DTO structure:
     ```typescript
     interface NewSkillData {
       isNewSkill: boolean;
       skill: {
         name: string;
         categoryId: string;
         id?: string;
       };
       userSkill: {
         note: string;
         videoUrl: string | null;
         sequence: SequenceStep[];
       };
     }
     ```

2. **Updated Action Types**
   - Replaced old actions with new ones that match the updated data structure:
     - `SET_CATEGORY_ID` instead of `SET_CATEGORY`
     - `SET_SKILL_NAME` and `SET_SKILL_ID` instead of `SET_SKILL`
     - Added `SET_IS_NEW_SKILL` for handling new vs existing skills

3. **Reducer Updates**
   - Modified state management to handle the nested structure
   - All sequence-related actions now operate on `userSkill.sequence`
   - Added proper type safety throughout the reducer

4. **Context API Changes**
   - Updated `SkillContextType` to use `UserSkillType` for recently created skills
   - Modified `addSkill` function to take `userId` parameter
   - Integrated with the new `createSkill` service function

5. **Service Integration**
   - Added proper error handling for skill creation
   - Implemented proper state reset after successful skill creation
   - Added TypeScript types for better type safety

### Benefits
1. Better alignment with backend API structure
2. Improved type safety throughout the skill creation flow
3. Clearer separation between skill and user skill data
4. More robust error handling

### Next Steps
1. Update components using the SkillContext to match new structure
2. Add validation for required fields
3. Implement proper error messaging in the UI
4. Add loading states for better user experience
