## Project Component Usage Guidelines

When developing new features or components, please adhere to the following guidelines:

*   **Text Elements**: Always use the `ThemedText.tsx` component for displaying text. This ensures consistency in typography and theme adherence.
*   **View Containers**: Utilize `ThemedView.tsx` for all general view containers. This helps maintain a consistent background and layout styling according to the current theme.
*   **Buttons**: For interactive button elements, use the `ThemedButton.tsx` component. It provides standard styling and theming for buttons across the application.
*   **Custom Components**: When designing new custom components that require theme-aware styling (e.g., dynamic colors based on light/dark mode), use the `useThemeColor.ts` hook. This hook should be used in conjunction with the color definitions in `Colors.ts` to ensure that custom components correctly adapt to theme changes.
